  <p>Founded in 2023, The League began as a full-fledged dynasty league. Each year, the managers compete to win the Champion's Cup & ring and avoid the ever-humiliating Toilet Bowl.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams by trading away future draft capitol, while others began the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. </p>
  <p>While the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending obnoxious snaps to the rest of the league for the next year, the champion manager also walks away with $450 and awarded the yearly Champion's ring by the commissioner.</p>
